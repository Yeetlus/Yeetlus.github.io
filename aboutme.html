  <h2>About me.</h2>
  <p> I am just some normal guy... well not really im kinda weird. Um but we dont really need to get into that. Probably my favorite game is Project Sekai/Hatsune Miku Colourfull stage. wait lemme just click enter then Ill be able to see what im typing...
  ok cool there we go. I am not good at Project Sekai in the slightest like the hardes song I have FC'ed (Full Comboed) was a 17 hard, Becoming Potatoes so really im not very good. Airi is my favorite character :D folled by Emu
    then Rui and then Nene probably. Hmm what else. Ummmm idk. I have a R.O.G Zephrys G14 which is SO ANNOYING BECAUSE IT DOESNT HAVE PAGEUP, PAGEDOWN, END OR HOME! WHAT THE HECK! I am a noob at coding although 2 people I know are making websites so I thought I might to.
  Also I love to hack on Minecraft. Um thats really it Ill and more later.</p>
